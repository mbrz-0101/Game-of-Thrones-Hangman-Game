# Game of Thrones Hangman - HTML, CSS, Javascript

Game of thrones hangman was my first venture into a browswer game built using Javascript. It allows the player to type letters to guess a random word displayed on the screen. This project involved front-end development such as styling the interface using HTML and CSS, and building the functionality of the game using a JS script. 

Put on your GoT cap and give it a try!
